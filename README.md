# CSE373

CSE 373 covers the theoretical and conceptual foundations of common data structures and algorithms. We emphasize the importance of creating and defending design decisions. Then, we apply these decisions in larger programming projects.

Specific technical topics we will cover include:

Data Structures and ADTs: lists, stacks, queues, sets, dictionaries, linked lists, arrays, trees, balanced trees, AVL trees, hash tables, priority queues, binary heaps, and disjoint sets.
Graphs and Graph Algorithms: graph search, shortest path, and minimum spanning trees.
Algorithm Analysis: asymptotic analysis, and P and NP complexity classes.
Sorting: insertion/exchanging and divide-and-conquer approaches.
This course is also designed to have a practical component to help you gain basic familiarity with techniques used within industry. In particular, youâ€™ll be asked to:

Work on programming projects and integrate your work in an existing codebase.
Learn how to use an industrial-strength IDE.
Learn techniques for checking correctness: writing unit tests with JUnit, designing and checking invariants, etc.
Learn how to collaborate on a single code base using source control repositories.
Taken together, all of the above skills are chosen to set you up for success in a software-related role. In fact, this course is typically regarded as useful preparation for industry and technical interviews.
